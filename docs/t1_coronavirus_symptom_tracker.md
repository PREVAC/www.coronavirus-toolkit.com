# T1: Coronavirus Symptom Tracker

## Rationale for Tool

Knowing if anyone has symptoms of Coronavirus helps you decide what to do next.  The most common symptoms of Coronavirus are recent onset of:

- new continuous cough and/or
- high temperature (above 100.0 degrees F / 37.8 degrees C)

Note: A new, continuous cough means coughing for longer than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours. If you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual.

## Example

- Each row represents a different date.
- Each column a different person in your household.
- **Track temperature (°F or °C) and cough symptoms (Y / N) every day at the same time.**
- The table below shows an example – everything is asymptomatic ('normal') until 28 Mar for person B.
- A template table for your household is provided overleaf

| **Date / Name** | **A** | **B** | **C** |
| 25 Mar 20 | 98.3 N | 98.6 N | 98.5 N |
| 26 Mar 20 | 98.1 N | 98.8 N | 98.6 N |
| 27 Mar 20 | 98.4 N | 99.6 N | 98.6 N |
| 28 Mar 20 | 98.4 N | 100.4 Y | 98.6 N |

## Other Causes of Body Temperature Variation

There are other factors that effect body temperature (Web MD). Raised temperature should only be considered a coronavirus symptom if it exceeds 100.0 degrees F / 37.8 degrees C.

## What to do if you think you have symptoms?

The advice varies from country to country, so make sure you know what to do before you need to act. A helpful summary of CDC guidance is here.

## T1: Coronavirus Symptom Tracker

Print out and complete one row per day for each person in your household. For additional people, or if you are advised to continue checking for symptoms beyond 14 days, print additional copies. If you do not have a printer produce the table by hand - it is the information that is important to you, not the format!

- Each row represents a different date.
- Each column a different person in your household.
- **Track temperature (degrees F or degrees C) and cough symptoms (Y / N) every day at the same time.**
- **It is very important you sanitize your thermometer between measurements**
